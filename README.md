# odin-recipes
This project is a basic recipe website
So far, I have created a new reop for the project on GitHub and I used the command line to move it to my local machine 
I had to refer back to previous lessons, but I was successful! 
Soon this will be second nature to me. I'll write more after I'm finished to mention what other skills I used for this project
